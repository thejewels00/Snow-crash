## What I found

First I found in the intra video that I need to find where there is a password to log in to **flag00**.
By scanning files I found an executable file owned by **flag00** using:

```
find / -user flag00 2>/dev/null
```

I found the same code in two files which is:

```
cdiiddwpgswtgt
```

By using a Caesar cipher (on dcode.fr) I found this code:

```
nottoohardhere
```

## Access steps / commands I used

```

Don't forget to launch getflag !
flag00@SnowCrash:~$ getflag
Check flag. Here is your token : x24ti5gi3x0ol2eh4esiuxias
```
